# Lecture 01 Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

## 1. Reinforcement Learning \(RL\) Background Knowledge 强化学习基本概念

### 1.1 RL in different fields 学科交叉与应用

* Machine Learning in Computer Science
* Reward System in Neuroscience
* Classical/Operant Conditioning in Psychology
* Bounded Rationality in Economics
* Operations Research in Mathematics
* Optimal Control in Engineering

### 1.2 Relationship between RL and Machine Learning \(ML\) 和机器学习的关系

ML includes Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and RL

### 1.3 Elements of a RL problem 基本元素

* **Reward \(R\_t\) 奖励**

A reward is a scalar feedback signal that indicates how well agent is doing at step t. 

**\[Def\] Reward Hypothesis** All goals can be described by the maximization of expected cumulative reward.

* **Goal 目标**

Select actions to maximize total future reward.

May sacrifice immediate reward to gain more long term reward. 考虑最大化未来累积奖励而不是即时奖励。
