# Lecture 01 Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

## 1. Reinforcement Learning \(RL\) Overview

### 1.1 RL in different fields

* Machine Learning in Computer Science
* Reward System in Neuroscience
* Classical/Operant Conditioning in Psychology
* Bounded Rationality in Economics
* Operations Research in Mathematics
* Optimal Control in Engineering

### 1.2 Relationship between RL and Machine Learning \(ML\)

ML includes Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and RL

### 1.3 Elements of a RL problem

* **Reward \(R\_t\)**

A reward is a scalar feedback signal that indicates how well agent is doing at step t. &lt;/n&gt; \[Def\] Reward Hypothesis All goals can be described by the maximization of expected cumulative reward.
