# Lecture 03 Planning by Dynamic Programming

### 3.1 Introduction to dynamic programming

* Dynamic means it has sequential or temporal components in the problem.
* Programming refers to mathematical optimization.
* Dynamic programming is a general solution method for problems with following two properties, Optimal substructure 是指最优问题可以分解成最优子问题，得到子问题的最优解就可以得到母问题的整体最优解 and Overlapping subproblems 子问题重复发生.
